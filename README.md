# DevOS
A hobby kernel made by [Avroman](https://github.com/Hlidskjalf), and [Heasummn](https://github.com/Heasummn).

## Different Architectures
Right now, the kernel only compiles for the i386 architecture. Though this is perfectly fine, but, expanding the Kernel to build upon different architectures would be a great contribution. Try to implement the driver interface, allowing us to write code that can use the drivers no matter what the architecture is.

## TODO:
There are a bunch of things missing from this basic kernel. Here's a list of things we plan to do.

- Get some keyboard input going.
- Begin implementing memory management. 
- Improving our build system. 
- GUI!
